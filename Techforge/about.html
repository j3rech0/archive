      <h1>why we started techforge</h1>
      <p>The first time I saw a website was way back in the age of Lycos and Alta Vista.  Yahoo! was just an upstart while Google, well… let's just say the wooly mammoth wasn't even part of the lingo yet.  It was a time when the best dial-up connection won the ISP battle, and leeching music files was all that jazz.  This was the state of the web and the Philippines didn't really pay much attention to it.  Oh, I did get the chance to build the coolest looking website in class – and everyone praised me for it.  Today, that website isn't much, it even reminds you of scenes from Star Trek and The Matrix – a relic if you call it.<br /><br />
Fast-forward a few years later, local companies mushroomed and started the website revolution, or so it was called.  These start-ups kept harping how having a website was the way to go, and you can't call yourself a company without one.  They claimed they were the "go-to" and that they were the experts – but nobody ever really was.  Of course, most of 'em either went bankrupt, or its founders went somewhere else – it just ain't where the money is.  Of course, those who persevered got rewarded, a thousand times fold – but at the expense of waiting it all out – sure wasn't practical.  So this was the Internet, and my buddies and I were just happy-go-lucky sods who enjoyed the web as much as it was free.  Browsing, file sharing, online gaming, and a whole lot more.
College back then was a pain in the ass – everyone had dreams but they say you'll get there when you graduate!  We were growing hungry, growing foolish – why not start right away?  We did just that.  Stuck in college, we started small-time projects from desktop apps to little websites for orgs.  CMS wasn't even known back then so everyone put up their websites, but eventually got tired managing it.  It was simply just a pain in the butt.  That's where we came in – we did the grunt work, and we managed websites too.  Sad to say it wasn't really prestigious - but hey, it paid for lunch.<br /><br />
After graduation that's when we teamed up to do more projects left and right.  Then came a time when one of our clients asked us for an official receipt!  Bingo.  We didn't have one! And out of urgency – that's when the company was born!  We crafted some funny names and consulted with close friends and relatives, and even did some superstition by consulting with a fortune teller.  It was all good.  Luck does play a factor after all.<br /><br />
And that's how the business was born.  We were in the right place, at the right time and lo and behold Lady Luck does exist.  The right place – well, we just got off from college, and it's the kind of school that gives you contacts ripe for project opportunities.  The right time was when knowledge about the web, from designing to programming was readily available and free from online communities.  This sure saved us a whole lotta trouble.  And trouble's the exact thing we're in for.<br /><br />
Our team, became a professional organization.  We exist to solve problems.  It's a simple B2B thing.  We offer our services to businesses coz they have a lot of headaches.  And as the world evolves, there'll definitely be a lot more headaches.  We smile at this!  What made us different was that we crafted solutions, and this has been what we've been good at.  Of course, this was just one aspect of the young company that we were back then.  We did a lot of 'information technology' systems for both startups and established enterprises.  But these solutions remained in the back-end.  They were in huge bolted servers, and remained cold pieces of code slowly humming to support a company's operations.  No one could see them, except project stakeholders and that's it.  Eventually, we realized that we needed to show-off.  We wanted to let people know that our work can be seen by the public eye.  And that's when we decided to offer more of our time to developing websites and everything else that was readily available online.  Having a www. afterall, is a 24/7 salesman.  And the more we built, the more we get the word out.  
While the usual companies built websites – I admire and respect them for their efforts but I don't get why they built their clients wallpaper sites.  Everyone knows what a wall paper is, it talks but it doesn't respond.  Where's the interaction in that?  The Internet, after all, is a medium that's interactive – you don't get that with TV, print, and radio.  With this in mind, we started offering digital marketing.  Hey, our services include not just getting you a better wheelchair, it was getting you a wheelchair that'll let you sell!
And that's what we do today, we provide solutions for both enterprise applications and commercial opportunities. We help brands, venture capitalists, and entrepreneurs get efficient and get online.  All it takes is the right amount of big hairy audacious goals, monster execution, tons of mutual respect, and the appropriate budget. Minor note here – the Internet is a big scary place.  Don't tell us we didn't warn you.  It takes a lot of guts and investment in time and resources to build and establish oneself online. This is not for the risk-averse.  If you thought the Internet and the people in it was cheap – it's not.  Its value grows everyday as we speak.  It has made billionaires out of garage nerds and celebrities out of bathroom singers.  And we're here to offer you just that – the digital edge.
